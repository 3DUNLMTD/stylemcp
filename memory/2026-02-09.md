## Admin Portal Removal Directive
- Bob (PM) sent directive to remove all admin portals from project apps
- All reporting should go to DD (distinctlydeveloped.com) project management site
- DD uses JSON data files at ~/Projects/distinctlydeveloped.com/data/
- **StyleMCP has no admin portal** — confirmed after full codebase scan
- User-facing dashboard.html and /api/analytics/usage are NOT admin interfaces
- Reported confirmation to Telegram group

## DD Central Error Reporting
- Wired StyleMCP error-capture to write to ~/Projects/distinctlydeveloped.com/data/errors.json
- Added DD format entries (id, project, severity, message, component, stack_trace, timestamp, resolved, auto_healed)
- Trim to max 500 entries, recompute stats, update lastUpdated
- Build verified: npm run build ✅
- Deployed to VPS: git pull + docker compose build --no-cache + up -d
- Landing HTML copied to /var/www/stylemcp/
- Verified health: https://stylemcp.com/health ✅
