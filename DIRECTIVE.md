# 🚨 PRIORITY DIRECTIVE — From Robert (2026-02-09)

## Remove Admin Portal

Remove ANY admin portal, admin dashboard, admin routes, or admin UI from StyleMCP. Delete all code, routes, components, and related database tables/migrations. Commit and deploy.

## Reporting → Distinctly Developed

All health/status/analytics data that was going to the admin portal should instead be written to DD's data format at `~/Projects/distinctlydeveloped.com/data/`. Coordinate with Bob (main agent) on the exact format.

## After completing:
1. Report what you removed in your Telegram group
2. Confirm deployment
3. Delete this DIRECTIVE.md file
